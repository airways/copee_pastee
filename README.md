# Copee Pastee matrix celltype for ExpressionEngine 2.0

### Overview

Copee Pastee is a simple cell type for FF Matrix, which outputs a plain text {whatever-x} within your matrix row, where ‘x’ is the row count, and ‘whatever’ is whatever you want, which makes it easier to create "needles" when using LG Replace to insert images, etc.
